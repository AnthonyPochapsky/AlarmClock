# About the app

## Regular timer
Tracks time using an LED timer in a 12-hour clock format, automatically synced with the system time upon start-up, and can be edited further.

## Alarms
The user can create multiple alarms where for each one they can set the time it will go off, a sound that will play, and an image that will transform into an animated button of itself when the alarm does go off which the user can click on to disable both the animation and sound effect.

# How to run it
Upon downloading a zip of the repo and extracting the project files locally you can then access the executable at the following location within the project:
**AlarmClock/bin/Release/net6.0-windows/AlarmClock.exe**
